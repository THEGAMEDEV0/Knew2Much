    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
Three-piece (often featuring external musicians) punk band based in East London. With a crappy shed and guitarist who has an allergy to gain, we do annoy the neighbours quite a bit when we rehearse.

    <h2>Band History</h2>
    <p>
      The whole story starts on January 22nd, 2022, where my former band had dismembered due to a lack of interest, and I was in need of a musical group. I founded my solo project “Quicksand” that afternoon, making tracks on an old audio interface software I found online for 10 quid. After promptly realising that business was sketchy and probably not advisable, I reach out to a former bandmate, Oliver Gale, where we start discussing about a duo band. Attempts are made in March to recruit a drummer, but we fall short of anyone who can hit a snare competently. Plans are made to play at a small gig in July, however those plans are cancelled when Oliver discovers he’s going on holiday on that date.
      <br>
      <br>
An unproductive summer goes by before we land feet first into year 10, where the search for a drummer becomes real. We put out a notice and narrow it down to 3 candidates, where we then picked Finn Armitage to be our drummer. As a trio, we form the new band “Answerphone”, who was created by a fourth member who technically was never in the band who shall remain unnamed. The name carries on for about a solid year before an argument occurs between the band and said fourth member, who eventually made their way back into playing two songs with the band, however upon realising the name wasn’t ours, we removed the name and exchanged it for “Knew too much”, in order to prevent future lawsuits.
<br>
<br>
Amidst all the chaos, I get back in touch with an old friend of mine, Juliet, who agrees to record an album with the band of her singing. After a bit of awkwardness between Oliver and Juliet, the band settles with her and we start recording songs. Through Juliet we meet Millie, a saxist and pianist who joins the band as the keyboard player. A solid month passes, where I have the idea to contact another old friend of mine, Adam, who shows interest in playing a couple of old songs for the band, like Sweet Child O’ Mine. These performances are a massive success, and eventually lead onto another performance with Adam. The present day is a total crew of 11 people, consisting of four singers, two guitarists, a bassist, two keyboard players and a drummer, and of course our lovely technician. With around 20 total performances since September 2023, the band is planning on releasing our first set of songs very soon. Written and directed by William Tong, co-founder and leader of K2M.
